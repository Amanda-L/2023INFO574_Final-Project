# WashU-INFO574-FinalProject-2023

The assignment requires me and teammates of 4 select a problem of interest and prepare an analysis to address the problem. To do the
analysis our group finds at least 2 independent datasets that can be combined.

Our project aims to explore the potential influence of various economic and environmental factors on obesity rates among adults. We hypothesize that there is a significant relationship between these variables, where changes in economic indicators and carbon emissions may correlate with variations in obesity prevalence.

## Datasets

1. Country Economic Indicators: This dataset offers a comprehensive view of the economic health and characteristics of countries. Sourced from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it includes indicators like:
'''
gross economic output (MLN_USD), per capita income (USD_CAP), average wages (AVWAGE), fertility rates (FERTILITY), employment (EMP), unemployment rates (UR), average hours worked (HRWKD), government debt (GGDEBT), and the proportion of young population (YNGPOP)
'''

These indicators are pivotal in understanding the economic landscape and demographic dynamics of each country.

3. Emissions by Country: Addressing the environmental aspect, this dataset, obtained from The Global Carbon Project (GCP) quantifies carbon emissions (MtCO2) for each country. Carbon emission levels are a crucial measure of a countryâ€™s environmental impact and contribute significantly to global climate change discussions.

4. Obesity among Adults by Country: From the World Health Organization, this dataset provides statistics on the prevalence of obesity (Obesity) among adults in different countries. It's a vital health indicator, reflecting the nutritional and lifestyle aspects impacting the population.

## Hypothesis:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant impact of the ten variables (MLN_USD, USD_CAP, AVWAGE, FERTILITY, EMP, UR, HRWKD, GGDEBT, YNGPOP, MtCO2) on adult obesity rates.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): At least one of the ten variables (MLN_USD, USD_CAP, AVWAGE, FERTILITY, EMP, UR, HRWKD, GGDEBT, YNGPOP, MtCO2) significantly impacts adult obesity rates.
